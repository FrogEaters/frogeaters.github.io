   <div class="information">
    <p>Pepe the Frog is a hate symbol used by the alt right as a pro-Trump and anti-minority meme. It's about a frog peeing with its pants completely pulled down. The meme was turned into cancer, during the 2016 election, thanks largely to Richard Spencer and Stephen Bannon. The pepe the frog meme is known as the first meme in history that has turned into a hate symbol.<br/ ><br/ >Pepe the Frog was created by American artist Matt Furie. Its usage as a meme came from his comic, Boy's Club #1. The progenitor of Boy's Club was a zine that Furie made on Microsoft Paint called Playtime, which included Pepe as a character. He posted his comic in a series of blog posts on Myspace in 2005.<br/ ></p>
